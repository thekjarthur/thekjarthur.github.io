        <p> 
          I learned to play the atenteben over a decade ago, as part
          of my primary school's music club. The atenteben is a Ghanaian
          bamboo flute. Since it is carved out of bamboo, the flutes are known to 
          warp over time. Common practice is to submerge the flutes in 
          water, to slow the warping effect. Often times, there are discrepancies in the pitch of tones. Two flutes carved by the 
          same artisan will inevitably have discrepancies in pitch, making 
          ensemble playing difficult for multiple flutes.
          I decided to make a set of molds to manufacture flutes with
          that could be played in ensemble. The plan is to use a set
          of molds, and epoxy to allow for customizable molds.

    <h4>Tone Placement Theory</h4>
    <p>
      Firstly, I calculated the dimensions of the flute and placement
      of tone holes, to produce desired pitches. Several corrections including
      viscous and thermal effects will eventually be taken into account. The 
      calculations are based on Musical Mathematics, by Cris Forster and 
      Acoustical Aspects of Woodwind Instruments, by Cornelis J. Nederveen. 
      The placement of each tone hole is calculated by the fundamental
      frequency of standing waves produced by a substitute tube of the same
      acoustic length, L_s, with a few corrections for the effects
      of the tone holes and embouchure holes, l_T and l_E, respectively.
    </p>
    <h4>Measured Frequency</h4>
    <p>To compare the theoretical pitch to the actual pitch on the atenteben, I recorded an octave and performed FFT Analysis in MATLAB.</p>

    <h4>Fabrication</h4>
    <p>Mold was first modelled in OnShape, and the prototype was made from materials from a hardware store, 3D printed parts and epoxy.</p>
