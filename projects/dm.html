<h2>Flash! Yoyo</h2>
<p>
	My team took inspiration from mechanical aperatures, and designed a yoyo mimicking a camera. I was specifically
	in charge of the lens and lens cap design, designing molds in Solidworks and generated the g-code in MasterCAM. 
	I was also incharge of  the manufacturing run for these parts, using optimized injection molding and thermoforming 
	to create the parts. This was the final project for Design and Manufacturing II, a class focused on teaching design 
	for manufacturing and provide hands-on experience on various methods of manufacturing. Our yoyo was also the fastest 
	spinning in the history of the class.
</p>
<h4>CAM with MasterCAM</h4>
<p>
	I designed the paperweight in Solidworks, and used MasterCAM to generate the necessary G-code for the CNC mills and lathes. This was the first project in the class, and was the test piece for optimizing several of the processes and tool selections.

<h4>Manufacturing and Finish</h4>
<p>The part was subsequently buffed after lathe and mill work. There were a few deformities in the stock that ended up in the final part. Not all arcs were as smooth as I had hoped. Vibrations and tool wear are likely other sources of error. A smaller tool, and more complex paths could have improved the final part. As I had limited run time, there was a limit to the speed and number of finishing passes I could take. Images taken with a surface microscope:</p>

<h4>Manufacturing Process Analyses</h4>
<p>We further analyzed the product and assembly process. The final analysis, including X-bar and R charts, is included in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wepniOOHBdnrbD_ZphrnenCFSea90TZlktNk91OhcDc/edit?usp=sharing">final report</a>. A table summarizing key measurements is shown below. </p>
