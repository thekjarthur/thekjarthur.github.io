        <h3>Next Big Tipper</h3>
        <p>
          In my freshman year at MIT, a new student group was initiated in my
          dorm. They built a rope swing in the courtyard. The group was named
          Next Big Thing and subsequent projects were much larger. I joined the
          group and worked on all the subsequent projects: a slide (<a
            href="https://tinyurl.com/hnwfuvj"
            >slipper</a
          >), a zip-line (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skd5k0NXA7Y"
            >zipper</a
          >) and a larger swing (<a href="#">flipper</a>). In the final semester
          of my junior year, I had the honor to design and lead the construction
          of a 16 ft. see-saw (tipper).

          A large part of project involved interfacting with MIT Environment,
          Health and Safety (MIT EHS), and the City of Cambridge, as the
          different groups had different regulations we had to abide by.
        </p>

          I learnt a lot from leading Big Tipper with my co-leaders; I spent
          quite a lot of time CADing and leading construction. Time management
          was crucial to the completion of the projects. My woodworking and
          project planning skills were greatly improved.
