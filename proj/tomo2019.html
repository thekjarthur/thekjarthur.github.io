        <h3>High-Resolution limited-angle phase tomography of dense layered objects using deep neural networks</h3>
        <h4><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821378116">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</a></h4>
        <p> 
          In this work, we used machine learning based method to perform tomography on dense layered objects. The projection range was higly limited, &#177 10&deg, and we showed that performance was maintain under low illumination. Our goal was to image integrated circuits (IC), and experimentally verified our method with an optically up-scaled setup.

          Rather than the typical approach of phase projection followed by 3-dimensional reconstruction, we used a single step method to reconstruct the 3-dimensional volume. We used a physics-informed prprocess step, in order to incorporate rigorous physical understanding to an otherwise end-to-end, black-box approach.

        <p>
          We also showed the effectiveness of training in simulation, while testing in experimentation. A typical issue with deep learning is the prohibitive sizes of training data. In the case of physical projects, such as reconstructing the interior of integrated circuits, one would have to image several thousands of sample ICs. Our method still produced high fidelity reconstructions with this synthetic data.
