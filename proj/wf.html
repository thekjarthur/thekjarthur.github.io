        <h3>Low Pressure Drop Filtration Using Horizontal Settling Chamber</h3>
        <p>
          We designed and tested a horizontal settling chameber for drip
          irrigation in developing countries, and in particular, for drip
          irrigation systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drip irrigation systems use pumps to pump water from a local water
          source through a pressurized network of plastic tubing installed along
          rows of crops. Drip emitters are located at every plant and allow
          water to be applied directly to the plant roots. Filters are typically
          required to remove impurities from the water that may potentially clog
          the small orifices of the drip emitters. Drip irrigation systems
          require higher pressure pumps - compared to flood irrigation, which
          only needs a low pressure pump (or none at all if water source has
          high head pressure) - in order to counteract all of the component
          pressure losses in the system. Drip irrigation has been shown to
          reduce water usage and improve crop yields by 70% and 50%,
          respectively, compared to flood irrigation. The major drawback to
          widespread adoptio, however, is the capital cost, the bulk of which is
          from the pumps and photovoltaic arrays (40-70%). The rating of the
          pump is determined by the pressure loss of the system, and recent
          improvments in the drip emitters loss, makes the water filter the next
          inefficient elemental in the irrigation system.

        <p>
          My team analyzed several filter types in use including media filters
          and hydroclone filters. We designed and testing a horizontal settling
          chamber, which would remove particles of certain density and size,
          targetting sand particulates which typically block the emitters. I
          proposed the idea, and ran the first order calculations to estimate
          the dimensions and features the horizontal settling chamber. Using
          Stokes' drag and scaling arguments, we could calculate therequired
          chamber size, given the size of the emitters and the particulate 
          properties. We built and tested a prototype, which achieved high 
          filtering efficiency (> 95%), with a very low pressure drop 
          (< 0.3 bar).

        <h4>Improvments</h4>
        Several modifications can be made to improve on the filtering efficiency
        and form factor of the system.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Baffles: Baffles can be added to the system, causing the water to
            flow sineously through the filter. This increases the effective
            length of the filter. There is a risk of inducing turblence which
            might kick up settled sand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turbulence: Another proposed idea is to use surface features on the
            bottom and top of the chamber, to induce rolling vortices. This
            would effecively cause a centrifugal accelerations on the particles,
            forcing them to be thrown out of the vortices.
