        <h3>Low Photon Count Phase Retrieval Using Deep Learning</h3>
        <h4><a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.243902">Physical Review Letters</a></h4>
        <p> 
          In this publication, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness
          of our physics-informed deep neural network in the phase retrieval problem under 
          extremely low photon counts. Compared with other classical iterative approaches, our method still maintains performance under conditions as low as 1 photon per pixel on average.

          Rather than the typical mean squared error, we used negative Pearson correlation coefficient (NPCC) as our loss function, as previous work from our group showed the effectiveness of this metric. We also used a physical preprocess step, as means to incorporate physical knowledge into the learning scheme.

          Imaging under such noisy conditions are particularly important when
          one has a limited imaging time or strict photon budget. The second case of 
          strict photon budget, is often seen in the medical field. In X-ray imaging
          for example, there are maximum dosages of radiation a patient can be exposed
          to at a time. A method that maintains performance when the photon dosage is 
          reduced is thus invaluable.
