    <h3>Flute</h3>
    <p> 
      I learned to play the atenteben when I was 10, as part
      of my school's music club. The atenteben is a ghanaian
      bamboo flute, played vertically, much like a recorder.
      Since it is carved out of bamboo, the flutes are known to 
      warp over time. Common practice is to submerge the flutes in 
      water, to slow the warping effect. Since it is carved by artisans, 
      there tends to be errors in pitch. Two flutes carved by the 
      same maker will deviate. This makes ensemble playing rather 
      difficult. Also, since flutes can't be tuned like string 
      instruments, their range is fixed (most are in B-flat or C).
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to make a set of molds to manufacure flutes with
      that could be played in ensemble. The plan is to use a set
      of molds, and epoxy to allow for customizable molds. 
    </p>

    <h4>Calculating Tone Holes</h4>
    <p>
      First, I calculated the dimensions of the flute, tones
      accurate to the first degree. There will likely be need for
      further correction. Viscious and thermal effects weren't taken
      into account. The calculation are based on [1] and [2], which
      were for concert flutes. Atenteben is different in several ways,
      requiring further adjustments. For each tone hole, the fundamental
      frequency of standing waves produced by a substitute tube of the same
      acoustic lenght, L_s, is used with a few corrections for the effects
      of the tone holes and embouchure holes, l_T and l_E.
