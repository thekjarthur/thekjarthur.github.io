    <p>Bearings and actuators are good enough for the final model. The bearing support will need to be improved upon; there will be addition parts screwed in below the block to provide structural support.</p>
    <p>The final dimensions for the subsequent components are all in the "dimensions" tab of the error-apportionment.xlsx. The FRDPARRC table hasn't changed though the error-budget spreadsheet has seen some update.</p>

    <p>The table is safe to operate. There was an issue with the motor controller overheating. This issue has been rectified. After building it the first time, I would be able to iterate and build a second desk in half the time, remedying most of the issues that were found during the first build.</p>
    <p>Part drawings may be accessed <a href="./drawings.pdf">here</a>. The final model can be view <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/cc740b01e7db80d67e17c87e/w/a89dc3b1c24aa3956bf9d050/e/0ee22ff38d343223b2f28047">online</a>.</p>

    <p>The full design of the machine is documented <a href="./table-design.html">here</a>. My MCM was my dovetail slider and actuation system. The dovetails were cut into the 2-by-8 with the center slab used as the carriage. I made sure to match the sides. To minimize misalignment, the bearing blocks are situated in the bearings instead of attached at the ends. A spider coupling will be used to mitigate large misalignments with the motor.</p>
