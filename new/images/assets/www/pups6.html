    <h1><center>Practical Uploadable Problem Set #6</center></h1>
    <h2>Peer Reviewers: Maria Ruiz, Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw</h2>
    <p>The first order error budget can accessed <a href="./week6/error-budget.xlsx">here</a>. I intend to create a preload by making a cut into the journal of the bearing. This will likely be a simple cantilever that is deflected by inteference fitting. This would decrease the stiffness, but it is a good countermeasure for "graceful failure". It will decrease bearing life since the teflon padding would degrade faster.</p>
    <h3>Risks and Conutermeasures</h3>
    <p>The desk is designed for 150 N of load with approriate safety factors but in the event of overloading by use, the table should fail in a predetermined "graceful manner". The cantilevered preloading will allow for a graceful failure. The position of the smaller beam should be placed in the direction of the loading at the bearing. </p>
    <p>The motor will be placed at the bottom of the bearing; there will be no loose wiring that could be caught be while the table is being actuated.</p>
    <p>The table has a very simple design which is very appealing. The truss and gusset envisioned my decrease it's aestitic value though some designs can be emploted to cover them or make them look better.</p>

    <p>I improved upon the sketch model of the wall-mounted table which will most likely be my final desk. The flat panel in this sketch model is flexible. This allows for a much better visualization of deflects by loading. St. Venant's Principle can easily be seen here as well. I will likely need transverse/diagonal trusses to resist twisting motion of the desk, when a load is applied on the outer edges.</p>

    <p>The anti-backlash system I made was a spring between two nuts. This would allow a leadscrew to actuate a carriage in both directions without backlash.</p>
