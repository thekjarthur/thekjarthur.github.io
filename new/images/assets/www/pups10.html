    <h1><center>Practical Uploadable Problem Set #9</center></h1>
    <h2>Peer Reviewers: Maria Ruiz, Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw</h2>
    <p>After much effort, the lumber was delivered and the other hardware was purchased and shipped. The tolerances achieved didn't match the desired. The individual modules and subsecetions of the table were constructed and fit well.</p>
    <p>Assembling the final machine was a very satisfying experience.</p>
    <p>The leadscrew also had a bend in it that caused the machine to wobble when actuated. Due to inadequate clamping, there was a larger than expected clearance between the carriage and the slider. The error was about 1.5 mm. To minimize this error, a preloadable carriage could be used. The rail could also be redone, including this error in calculations. The 1.5 mm error leads to a 15° angular deflection and an abbey error of 5 cm.</p>
    <p> The table feels remarkably rigid. This is due to the diagonals included, as well as the ¾ inch table thickness. When the operating load was applied (laptop, mug of water and a notebook), the deflection was well within the 2 mm expectation  (measurement was less than 1 mm).</p>
