    <h1>SEEK AND GEEK 4: AUTOMATONS</h1>
    <p> 
      Draughtsman-Writer is an automaton built by Swiss mechanician  Henri Maillardet in the 18th century. It had the largest memory at it's time with a capability of four drawings and three poems! I think automatons are incredible since it shows human ingenuity irrespective of period. They are able to simulate life and art in a purely mechanical system.

    <p>
      The memory of the automaton was stored in brass cams. They are turned by a motor (clockwork motor) and three fingers act as followers. They translate the movements of the cam into side to side, front and back and up and down movements of the doll's hand using several rod, lever and other interesting mechanisms.
