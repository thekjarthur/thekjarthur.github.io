    <h2>Peer Reviewers: Maria Ruiz, Akwasi Owusu-Akyaw</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Bill of Materials</h3>
    <p>Preliminary B.O.M. is listed below. Only two pieces of lumber were needed. The electronics were purchased from the local electronics store.</p>
    <p><ol>
      <li>2 x 8 Plank of Wood (10ft)</li>
      <li>1' x 2' x 1/4" Plywood</li>
      <br>
      <li>Teflon Pad</li>
      <li>Wood Screws</li>
      <li>Wood Glue</li>
      <br>
      <li>Ball Bearings</li>
      <li>Leadscrew</li>
      <li>Motor</li>
      <li>Spider Coupling</li>
      <li>Motor Driver / Microcontroller</li>
      <li>Power Supply</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3>Manufacturing Error</h3>
    <p>Backlash/Tolerance: The bearings were supposed to have 0.001" backlash. This was going to be achieved by clamping a paper between the carriage and the bearing. The bearing would be glued and clamped in order for this 0.001" tolerance to be kept. Sliding the carriage through the bearing, the tolerance varies quite a bit. This is most likely due to manufacturing errors present in the tablesaw.</p>
    <p>Leadscrew misalignment: a spider coupling was used in order to mitigate effects of motor-axle misalignment. When the carriage is loaded, the leadscrew had some slight deflection unaccounted for in the manufacturing. </p>
    <p>There were some assembly issues: two screws were very eager to dig into bearing and this caused some damage to the slider.</p>
